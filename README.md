tkinter as tk: Imports the Tkinter library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and renames it to tk for easier use.
messagebox: Imports the messagebox module from Tkinter for displaying pop-up messages.
datetime: Imports the datetime module for working with dates and times.
Main Window:

root = tk.Tk(): Initializes the main application window.
root.title("Personal Diary"): Sets the title of the window to "Personal Diary".
root.geometry("700x600"): Sets the window's size to 700 pixels wide and 600 pixels high.
root.configure(bg="#2b2d42"): Sets the background color of the window to a dark gray for a modern look.
Save Entry Function:

def save_entry(): Defines a function named save_entry that handles saving the diary entry.
content = text_area.get("1.0", tk.END).strip(): Retrieves the content entered into the text area, removes any leading or trailing whitespace characters using strip().
if content:: Checks if the content is not empty.
date_str = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d"): Gets the current date in a formatted string (YYYY-MM-DD) using datetime.
filename = f"Diary_{date_str}.txt": Creates a filename for the diary entry with the format "Diary_{date_str}.txt".
with open(filename, "w") as file:: Opens a file with the generated filename in write mode ("w") within a context manager (with open).
file.write(content): Writes the diary entry content to the opened file.
messagebox.showinfo("Success", f"Entry saved as {filename}!"): Displays a success message with the filename using messagebox.showinfo.
text_area.delete("1.0", tk.END): Clears the text area after saving the entry.

GUI Layout:

Header Label: Creates a label with the text "Dear Diary" using tk.Label.
Text Area: Creates a multiline text input field using tk.Text for writing diary entries.
Save Button: Creates a button with the text "Save Entry" using tk.Button. Clicking this button calls the save_entry function to save the entry.
Main Loop:

root.mainloop(): Starts the Tkinter event loop, waiting for user interactions like button clicks. This keeps the window running and responsive.
Overall Function:

This code provides a user-friendly way to write and save diary entries. Users can type their entries in the text area and click the "Save Entry" button to save them as text files with dates in the filenames.
